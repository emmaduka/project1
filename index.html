                    <h1>We Are Africa's Largest Institute of Deep Technology And Sciences</h1>
                    <p>The Pan African Institute of Technology, Research, and Innovation
                        is a new model for tertiary education which is geared towards raising
                        new generations of African intellects who will drive innovation, propel new 
                        industries, and pioneer numerous technological advancements from the African 
                        continent.</p>
                        <p>We seek to improve human capital and brainpower innovation in Africa by providing

                            and resources that will help them bring new ideas to fruition, ideas that we hope will in time
                           mould Africa into a global innovation and development hub and a launchpad from which a variety of
                           new technological breakthroughs can take off</p>

    <h1>Courses Sections</h1>
    <p>Our courses are divided into three sections</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="coursecol">
            <h3>Emerging Industries</h3>
            <p>
                We train our students in emerging industries so that they can become dominant players
                when these industries becomes mainstream. In the words of Dr Michio Kaku, "countries that will rise to
                the top are those who invest in innovative brainpower industries of the future" hence our students
                receive both practical and theoretical training in these industries of the future. We also equip them
                 with finances and corporate partnerships to enable them carry out research and development, as well
                as build companies around these industries 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coursecol">
            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>This course section is geared towards training our students to get their hands dirty
                once in a while. We want our students to be able to make practical use of machines and industrial
                equipment through the acquisition of technical skills as these are skills which will not only help
                 them in their research and development efforts but also aid their creative process
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coursecol">
            <h3>Auxiliary Fields</h3>
            <p>This course section involves courses in other fields of study especially those that are outside
                the realms of science and Technology. Part of what we do is to train our students to become extremely
                creative and one factor that boosts creativity is the ability to connect a wide variety of ideas from
                different disciplines. Afterall, you can only think outside the box if you have an idea of what's 
                outside the box
