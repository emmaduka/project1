            <div class="question">
                How many years does a programme at this institution last?
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div class="answer">
                Every programme lasts two years
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                How many courses are each student required to take?
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div class="answer">
                Each student is required to take as many courses as he/she wants but the least they can take 
                is two courses from each course section
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                How often are classes held in the lecture halls?
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div class="answer">
                Classes are held three days a week between 10am and 2pm. Our students spend more of their 
                time working in the lab or testing new products in the R&D facilities
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                Since this is a new model for tertiary education, is the examination model similar to
                that of conventional universities?
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div class="answer">
                Our examination model is much different. Every student knows the only examination question at the 
                start of the program, which is; During your stay here and in each course that you have taken, what new 
                ideas have you come up with and how far have you gone in bringing them to reality? That's really 
                it. This way our students focus more on using what they've learnt as opposed to learning to forget
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                How old must I be to be able to study here?
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div class="answer">
                Anyone between the ages of 16 and 60 is welcome here
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                Must I have any degree before I can be accepted here? If so, which?
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div class="answer">
                As long as you meet our criteria we will accept you with or without a degree. However, we advice 
                that you first acquire a bachelor's degree before attempting to come here as this degree prepares you 
                for life here. Having a degree is not compulsory but it's advisable
            </div>
